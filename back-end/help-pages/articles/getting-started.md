# Creating a campaign

Welcome to Campaign Buddy, your dungeons and dragons campaign tool box! We’re so glad you’re here and can’t wait to start helping you plan your campaigns so you can focus on creating an awesome experience for your players. Once you log into Campaign Buddy with your Google account, you’ll be ready to start planning and running your game.

After logging in, you’ll be taken to you’re home page where you can see all of the campaigns that you have created and create new ones. Go ahead and click the new campaign button and give it a name. It’s okay if you aren’t sure what you want to call it because you can change it later. Once you do that, you’ll be taken to your campaign’s page where you can set up your workspace and begin planning.

# Adding tools to your workspace

Initially, your workspace will be blank but you can easily change that by adding a tool to the screen by clicking on the dropdown menu or by selecting one from the "Tools" menu. Tools are various features of Campaign Buddy designed to make a specific part of your job as a DM easier. The character tool is designed to help you manage your players and NPCs, the notes tool allows you to organize your thoughts, the music tool allows you to control mood music via a linked spotify account, the search tool lets you search spells, items, and other content, and so on. For the purposes of this guide, go ahead and open the dice roll tool.

When you add the dice roll tool, you will see a new tab open in your workspace containing the dice roll tool. You can have multiple tools open at the same time by either right clicking on the tab or by selecting a new tool from the "Tools" menu. Go ahead and add a character tool to the workspace. Right now, we aren’t actually going to use these tools but if you want you can checkout "Using the Character Tool" or "Using the Dice Roll Tool".

# Organizing your workspace and saving layouts

One of the cool features of Campaign Buddy is that you have complete control over what your workspace looks like so you can see everything you need at once in an organized way that makes sense to you without giving yourself a headache. To reorganize the layout, simply drag and drop the tabs into where you want them in the workspace. You can even drag tabs into each other so you can switch between them in the same panel. You can resize the tools by dragging on the black dividers so you can make more room for certain tools or minimize tools you aren’t using at the moment.

Often times, you will need to work the same few layouts in different contexts. Campaign Buddy makes it easy to switch between different layouts so you don’t have to worry about constantly adding, moving, and resizing tabs over and over again. Once you have your workspace layout set up in a way that’s useful (characters on the left and notes and dice on the right for example), you can save that layout by selecting "Save this Layout" from the "Layout" menu. Then, you can go into **Layout -> Saved Layouts** and instantly load that workspace layout at any time.

![Loading Layouts](https://res.cloudinary.com/josephdangerstewart/image/upload/v1562788784/campaign-buddy/help-pages/getting-started/loading-layouts.png)

If you select "Edit Layouts" from the "Layout" menu, you will be able to rename and delete your saved layouts as well as set a default layout so it automatically loads when you open your workspace. To set a layout as default, hover over it and toggle the checkmark on.
